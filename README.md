simple-async
============

A very lightweight javascript library for async iteration. Callback-chain-free. Zero dependency.

Everytime I needed to do async iteration (for e.g. loading content sequentially from web services), ended up writing different versions of same logic to help. So why not put it up for everyone who needs it.

This library is modular and thin, easy-to-integrate with any libraries. And most importantly very simple.

Usage
=====

```js
var a = ["a", "b", "c"];
// You could do a for-loop, but why do that when you can do it async!
new AsyncIterator(
    a, function(iterator){
      // step
      console.log("in step - " + iterator.current() + " - Remaining - " + iterator.remaining());
      iterator.step();
    }, function(iterator){
      // start
      console.log("Starting the iteration");
    }, function(iterator){
      // end
      console.log("Ending the iteration");
    }
).step();

```
